He joined KCT and chose ECE as his discipline. Stepping into his freshman year, he lacked in understanding English and communicating was a big struggle but he tries to overcome by reading story books. Although, he never lacked in academics as he scored proficiently through the semesters. Rather than studying his syllabus he was also part of the chess team of KCT in his first year. But he aspires to do an invention that will benefit people.<br><br>It was in his 2nd year he realised that he should do something in order to realise his dreams. He started to self-learn C programming language. Despise starting absolutely from scratch, his determination to learn something new, paid him off. Once mastering his new skill, he realised his new-found love for programming. His next venture into the programming world was Python. His journey has led him to go through web development where he learnt HTML, CSS, Java Script, JQuery, PHP, MySQL hoping to become a full stack web developer.<br><br>Questioning himself where would all these help him, he thought of applying all his previously learnt skills at the start of his 3rd year at college. Thatâ€™s when the idea of Machine Learning came to him. Naturally being himself, he leaped into it hoping to expand his learning curve further ahead. Currently he is working on deep leaning and has planned to do a project using machine learning.<br><br>His curious tale from an absolute zero to rocketing glory is a story in itself which will definitely be an inspiration for many who have had similar beginnings."</p><h3><span>- Tarun Sirpi & Sathiyanarayanan</span></h3></div><div class="share"><h2><span>Share your Thoughts</span></h2><form id="thoughts-form"><input type="text" placeholder="Your Name" id="thoughts-name" required> <input type="thoghts-email" placeholder="Your Email Address" id="thoughts-email" required> <textarea id="thoughts-message" cols="30" rows="10" placeholder="Your Thoughts about me" required></textarea> <button type="thoughts-submit">share</button></form></div><gp-footer></gp-footer><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emailjs-com@2.3.2/dist/email.min.js"></script><script defer="defer">emailjs.init("user_qpT70THnybLbCeuMz73EF")</script><script src="js/main.js"></script></body></html>
